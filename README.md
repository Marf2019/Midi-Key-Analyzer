# Midi-Key-Analyzer
The Midi Key Analyzer let's you analyze the key of a midi.
It lets you enable and disbale tracks, visualize patterns and play the midi.

Using the midi key analyzer is very simple.
Just extract the files, open 'Midi Key Analyzer.exe' and enjoy!

NOTE: Upon playing a midi for the first time the program will freeze for a couple seconds.
This only happens the first time you use the midi player.
